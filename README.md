## Why facepalms drive me

Everybody knows, that the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything is 42. On a smaller scale however, it seems that the role of people, societies and mankind adds up to "The Hardly Sustainable Facepalm". We, the pinnacle of evolution on Earth, develop just fast enough not to annihilate ourselves immediately, but the margin by which we somehow keep going feels painfully small.

Realizing The Hardly Sustainable Facepalm coincided serendipitously with my final steps to self-discovery and eventually made "cutting bullshit and making sense" a driving principle of my life. I ended up with a pathological impulse to do and somehow succeed at stuff way beyond my capabilities and I've been enjoying the ride to the fullest. 

This project tops it all. It has maybe like a million to one chance to become anywhere close to usable, but frankly I couldn't care less. Its been a real itch in my bones for years and since it requires some serious open-source collaboration I hope you'll just read on and maybe contribute by filing a bug or committing a pull-request.

## The goal

The Grand Ultimate Goal is to build a culture (people connected through shared values) that

  - **leaves less space for bullshit™**
  - **is compelling and accommodating**
  - **is consciously evolving**
  - **can interface well with existing cultures (and survive in adverse conditions)**
  - **is self-contained with no loose ends**

## The principles

The following principles are just a list of keywords intended to make you interested. Some can be probably derived from the others, so we'll need to streamline and simplify this later. For now, let's go with

  - meritocracy / practical reputation economy
  - change is the only constant
  - freedom, self-determination and respect
  - sustainability
  - making sense and absence of (self-)deceive
