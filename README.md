# Culture

Culture /ˈkʌltʃə/: _shared values, customs, and behaviour of a particular people or society_

## Why facepalms drive me

Everybody knows, that the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything is 42. On a smaller scale however, it seems that the role of people, societies and mankind adds up to "The Hardly Sustainable Facepalm". We, the pinnacle of evolution on Earth, develop just fast enough not to annihilate ourselves immediately, but the margin by which we somehow keep going feels painfully small.

Realizing The Hardly Sustainable Facepalm coincided serendipitously with my final steps to self-discovery and eventually made "cutting bullshit and making sense" a driving principle of my life. I ended up with a pathological impulse to do and somehow succeed at stuff way beyond my capabilities and I've been enjoying the ride to the fullest. 

This project tops it all. It has maybe like a million to one chance to become anywhere close to usable, but frankly I couldn't care less. Its been a real itch in my bones for years and since it requires some serious open-source collaboration I hope you'll just read on and maybe contribute by filing a bug or committing a pull-request. All suggestions, improvements and critique will be gladly accepted.

## The goal

The Grand Ultimate Goal is to build a culture (people connected through shared values) that

  - **leaves less space for bullshit™**
  - **is [compelling](goals/compelling.md)**
  - **can interface well with existing cultures (and survive in adverse conditions)**
  - **is self-contained with no loose ends**

## The principles

The following principles are just a list of keywords intended to make you interested. Some can be probably derived from the others, so we'll need to streamline and simplify this later. For now, let's go with

  - meritocracy / practical reputation economy
  - change is the only constant
  - freedom, self-determination and respect
  - sustainability
  - making sense and absence of (self-)deceive
  
## The road towards applicability (eating your own dog-food)

People won't accept a culture, unless there's a compelling **perceived value**. So, offering a different take on value exchange with some neat philosophical aspects is just not enough to attract reasonable adoption rates. This is where proper **interfacing** with current cultures is required. Consider only the economic aspects, people will still need to pay bills and buy food outside the culture's framework.

Thus, to kickstart adoption, the idea is to set up and run organizations and businesses that, on the inside, work within the culture's framework, but on the outside also provide the needed interfacing by paying wages, taxes, etc. These organizations are currently spawned according to the Kyocera model (having lots of small, but sharply focused business units, each seeking market excellence and dominance in a specific niche), while adhering to the [lattice](concepts/lattice.md) and [meritocracy](concepts/reputation-economy.md) principles. Among one another, these organizations exchange value according to both, the outside and the inside culture.

## Challenges

- **Universal applicability** Lets not kid ourselves, that this culture could be universally applicable to everyone. Early adopters will be a piece of cake, but dealing with the first generation of children born into the system may be easily lost. While the measure of [merit](concepts/reputation-economy.md) may include a measure of latent talent and the whole model revolves around enabling people to find a fulfilling place for themselves in the society, this will most likely end up with a nasty disaster. Accordingly, damage control should be already planned ahead (possibility to reject the culture, really well defined coexistence with current cultures, etc.)
