# Reputation economy

**Meritocracy** is (according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy)) a political philosophy which holds that certain things, such as economic goods or power, should be vested in individuals on the basis of talent, effort and achievement. 
As with any political philosophy, Meritocracy is only as good as is its implementation (see criticism in the wikipedia's entry). The most important (and difficult) parts, are

- the deifinition of merit
- the value-merit exchange mechanism

which both together construct the reputation economy, which defines success or failure of the meritocracy.

## Merit

The current concept of merit for this culture consists of:

- skill/talent/capability in a field (I must respect John as the most skilled chef preparing pizza)
- capacity to sponsor others in the field (Jeff is the best teacher of mathematics)
- ability to cooperate in a field (If I need a carpenter's skill in my project, I'll be happiest with Fred)

## Economy

- **Field size** - We let people adjust fields (and their size). A more fine-grained definition of a field will accomodate less people (amount of reputation tokens in the field will be inverse to the fine-grainedness of the field),
a coarsely-defined field will be more competitive.
- **Translating merit to fiat currency** - A part of the economic output of each business unit will be distributed according to achieved merit
