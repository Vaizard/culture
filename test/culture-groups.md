# Culture Groups Test

- select focus group
- ask
  - what behaviour makes your organization successfull (give all answers, you can think of)
  - mark replies as positive or negative (i.e. if lieing to someone is the only way to make projects a success, mark it as a negative and vice versa)
- group replies in such a manner, that you don't get duplicate statements, but also don't miss out something important
- send out the selection again and ask:
  - for each statement please assign a number on the scale from 0 .. 10 to describe the statement's impact on success
  - for each statement please assign a number on the scale from 0 .. 10 to describe how hard is it to learn the statement
  - don't make this anonymous.
